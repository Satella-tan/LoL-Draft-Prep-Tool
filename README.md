##  What is this?

Online tool that helps teams prepare for a draft by exploring "what if" scenarios. Each node in the tree represents a draft state, and you can branch off to explore different possibilities.



## Features

- **Branching draft tree -**  Build and explore multiple *what-if* draft scenarios using a node-based structure.
- **Draft state per node -**  Each node stores a complete draft snapshot (Blue/Red picks and bans).
- **Visual & list navigation -**  Navigate your preparation either through an interactive tree or a compact list view.
- **Interactive draft editor -**  Select any node to view or edit its draft in a dedicated pick/ban editor.
- **Offline & persistent -**  Runs entirely in the browser and saves your preparation locally. Allows download/load JSON.
